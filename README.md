# Deforestation_Exploration
Extracurricular Project in the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree Program. 

We’re data analysts for ForestQuery, a non-profit organization. on a mission to reduce deforestation around the world and which raises awareness about this important environmental topic.

Our executive director and her leadership team members are looking to understand which countries and regions around the world seem to have forests that have been shrinking in size, and also which countries and regions have the most significant forest area, both in terms of amount and percent of total area. The hope is that these findings can help inform initiatives, communications, and personnel allocation to achieve the largest impact with the precious few resources that the organization has at its disposal.

We’ve been able to find tables of data online dealing with forestation as well as total land area and region groupings, and we’ve brought these tables together into a database that we’d like to query to answer some of the most important questions in preparation for a meeting with the ForestQuery executive team coming up in a few days. Ahead of the meeting, we’d like to prepare and disseminate a report for the leadership team that uses complete sentences to help them understand the global deforestation overview between 1990 and 2016.

Instructions

We will be creating a report for the executive team in which we explain your results using complete sentences.

Report Sections
The report has five sections that you will need to complete:

    - Global Situation
    - Regional Outlook
    - Country-Level Detail
    - Recommendations
    - Appendix: SQL queries used

## What do you need to run the SQL code:
The relational database we were using for this project was version 9.6 of PostgreSQL. 
There are many ways to install Postgres on your computer, and the easiest one is going through Docker:
https://docs.docker.com/samples/postgresql_service/

All the exercises for this project were done using a Udacity Postgres workspace. 
The Udacity Postgres workspace is a real instance of Postgres that behaves exactly like those outside the workspace.
