Steps to Complete

    Create a View called “forestation” by joining all three tables - forest_area,
     land_area and regions in the workspace.
    The forest_area and land_area tables join on both country_code AND year.
    The regions table joins these based on only country_code.

    In the ‘forestation’ View, include the following:
        All of the columns of the origin tables
        A new column that provides the percent of the land area that is designated as forest.

    Keep in mind that the column forest_area_sqkm in the forest_area table and the land_area_sqmi
    in the land_area table are in different units (square kilometers and square miles, respectively),
    so an adjustment will need to be made in the calculation you write (1 sq mi = 2.59 sq km).

CREATE VIEW forestation AS
SELECT f.country_code AS country_code, f.country_name AS country_name,
f.year AS year, f.forest_area_sqkm AS forest_area_sqkm,

    Use the output from the query to answer these questions.

1a. What was the total forest area (in sq km) of the world in 1990?
   Please keep in mind that you can use the country record denoted as “World" in the region table.

1b. What was the total forest area (in sq km) of the world in 2016?
